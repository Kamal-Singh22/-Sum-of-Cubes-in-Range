# -Sum-of-Cubes-in-Range
Given two integers  𝑀 M and  𝑁 N, calculate the sum of the cubes of all integers from  𝑀 M to  𝑁 N. If  𝑀 M is greater than  𝑁 N, return 0 and print an appropriate message, indicating that the range is invalid.
Explanation of the Code
Range Check: If 
𝑀
M is greater than 
𝑁
N, print an error message and return 0.
Sum Calculation: Loop from 
𝑀
M to 
𝑁
N, adding the cube of each integer to the sum.
Output: Print the sum of cubes if the range is valid.
